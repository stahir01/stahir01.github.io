                        My journey into Data Science began with a fascination for dashboards and an ever-present curiosity about the stock market. Driven by a desire to understand the numbers behind the scenes, 
                        I decided to dive into the field, immersing myself in Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning courses. Learning the essentials gave me the foundation I needed, but I was hungry for
                         more—specifically, hands-on experience with real-world applications in the financial domain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="full-width-paragraph">
                    I set out to bring these concepts to life, designing projects that could provide actionable insights. From customer segmentation and churn prediction to stock price 
                    forecasting, I chose challenges that felt both practical and exciting. Each project was a new opportunity to bridge theory and practice, turning abstract ideas into models with real-world potential. 
                    Below, you'll find some of these Machine Learning projects—each a stepping stone on my path from curiosity to expertise.

                        In a world where data reigns, the question isn’t just “Who are my customers?” but rather, “How can I understand and serve them better?” This project aimed to answer that, diving into the realm of customer segmentation to uncover patterns in customer behavior that would inform targeted marketing and personalized experiences.

                        My task was to categorize customers based on their behaviors and demographic data, creating actionable groups that could guide smarter decisions. To start, I gathered and meticulously cleaned data on purchasing history, customer frequency, and demographics to ensure a solid foundation. From there, I engineered new features—like recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM)—which capture the essentials of customer loyalty and engagement.

                    <p class="full-width-paragraph">
                        To segment the customers effectively, I trained various models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). After extensive tuning and evaluation, the CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy, reaching a 98% F1 score. This high accuracy demonstrates the model's ability to capture and categorize customer behaviors with remarkable precision.

                        This project marked my first hands-on experience in Machine Learning, focusing on a critical business challenge: customer churn prediction. Churn prediction helps companies identify which customers are likely to leave, enabling them to take proactive steps to improve customer retention and satisfaction.

                        For this project, I used a telecommunications dataset with features such as account length, call usage patterns, and service plan details. My goal was to build a model that accurately predicted whether a customer would switch providers. I preprocessed the data by transforming categorical variables, engineering features, and scaling the dataset for optimal model performance.

                        I trained multiple models, including **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**. After extensive tuning and cross-validation, the **Random Forest model** achieved the best results with an accuracy of 95% and a solid F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the patterns associated with customer churn.

                        This project gave me a solid foundation in Machine Learning techniques and provided valuable insights into the factors that influence customer churn. With a well-trained model, businesses can use this predictive tool to retain at-risk customers by offering tailored interventions, ultimately improving customer loyalty and satisfaction.

                        My fascination with the stock market and data dashboards led me to this project—my very first foray into using Machine Learning to predict stock prices. Wall Street and the dynamics of stock prices had always intrigued me, and this project gave me the perfect chance to explore that interest through data science.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="full-width-paragraph">
                        I aimed to forecast stock prices using time series data, experimenting with both **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and **FB Prophet**. Using a dataset containing stock prices over several years, I set out to understand patterns in historical data and build a model capable of making accurate predictions. The data required preprocessing, including normalization and transformation into sequences, so the models could recognize and leverage patterns over time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="full-width-paragraph">
                        The **LSTM model** was effective in capturing temporal dependencies in the data, while FB Prophet provided an alternative approach that excelled in handling seasonality. After fine-tuning, the LSTM model achieved a promising accuracy in predicting stock trends, demonstrating its strength in time series forecasting. Prophet, on the other hand, offered a complementary perspective by visualizing trends and seasonality, which added valuable insights.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="full-width-paragraph">
                        This project not only deepened my understanding of stock market trends but also laid a solid foundation in time series forecasting. With these models, I was able to gain insights into potential price movements, making this experience both rewarding and insightful. This hands-on journey into forecasting marked the beginning of my passion for using data science in financial analysis.
